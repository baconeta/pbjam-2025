  aboutMeToMarie: "Hey, I\u2019m Geralt. I\u2019m 29.\r\nMy days are split between
    keeping up with little feet\u2026 and staying strong enough to carry it all.\r\nNights?
    That\u2019s when I unwind, lose myself in other worlds just me and the screen.\r\nA
    few small things keep me grounded.\r\nI have  little patience for things that
    left a foul taste or clouded the mind.\r\n"
